Small initial project with potential for ongoing extension improvements. Please share your relevant experience with Chrome extensions and Shadow DOM styling.
-------------------
To address the project description, you'll be optimizing and cleaning up the CSS in a Chrome extension built with Svelte 5 and WXT framework. Below is a breakdown of the tasks, along with code samples to help address the specific issues mentioned:
1. Fixing Shadow DOM CSS Issues

The Shadow DOM is a part of the web components API that allows encapsulation of styles. When using Shadow DOM, styles from the global document don’t affect the shadow root by default. You'll need to ensure that the styles are correctly scoped within the shadow DOM.

Here’s how to approach it:
CSS for Shadow DOM (Scoped Styles)

Ensure that styles within the Shadow DOM are scoped properly. Here's an example of how you might handle the CSS for a component inside the shadow DOM:

/* Shadow DOM Scoped Styles */
:host {
  display: block;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #fff;
}

:host(.active) {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

button {
  color: #333;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 5px 10px;
  background-color: #fafafa;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #ddd;
}

This way, all the styles inside the shadow DOM are scoped to that component and won't affect the global document styles.
Working with Svelte's Shadow DOM

In Svelte 5, you can use the style attribute or scoped styles inside a <style> tag. Make sure the styles are placed in the <style> tag within the Svelte component to apply them within the shadow DOM:

<!-- Component.svelte -->
<script>
  // Your logic
</script>

<style>
  /* Scoped CSS for Shadow DOM */
  :global(button) {
    background-color: #3b82f6;
    border: none;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }

  :global(button:hover) {
    background-color: #2563eb;
  }
</style>

<button>Click Me!</button>

In the example above:

    The styles are scoped using :global to apply the button styles across the shadow DOM and the main DOM.
    Shadow DOM styles are encapsulated with :host and scoped styles are used directly within the component.

2. Removing Duplicate CSS Overrides

To clean up duplicate CSS rules, you need to look for conflicting or repeated CSS selectors. Here's an approach for cleaning up CSS:

    Identify Duplicate CSS: Use tools like CSS Lint or Chrome Developer Tools to find and remove duplicate CSS. These tools highlight repetitive CSS rules.

    Optimize CSS Code: Refactor your styles and use CSS inheritance to remove redundancy.

Example:

Before cleanup:

/* Duplicate Styles */
.button {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
}

.button {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
}

.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
}

After cleanup:

/* Optimized Styles */
.button {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  padding: 10px 20px;
}

    Consolidate Style Rules: Combine related style rules for efficiency.

3. Cleaning Up Unused Styles

Identify and remove unused CSS selectors. This can be done manually by reviewing the CSS or using tools like PurgeCSS or UnCSS to automate the process. These tools help identify styles that aren’t being applied.

Example:

    PurgeCSS: Add PurgeCSS to your build pipeline to automatically remove unused CSS during production build.

// In your build tool (e.g., Rollup or Webpack config)
import purgecss from '@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss';

export default {
  plugins: [
    purgecss({
      content: ['./src/**/*.svelte', './public/index.html'],
    }),
  ],
};

This ensures that only the necessary CSS is included in the final build.
4. Making the Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

To make the code DRY, you can refactor and consolidate repetitive styles into reusable components or variables.

Example using Svelte and CSS Variables:

<script>
  let primaryColor = '#3498db';
  let hoverColor = '#2980b9';
</script>

<style>
  button {
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
  }

  button:hover {
    background-color: var(--hover-color);
  }
</style>

<button>Click Me!</button>

Here, by using CSS variables, you ensure that your code is reusable, making it easier to update styles globally without redundant code.
5. WXT Framework Optimization (if applicable)

If you're using the WXT framework, it helps to ensure that styles are being applied correctly and avoid conflicts between the global and shadow DOM scopes.

import { WXTComponent } from 'wxt';

class MyComponent extends WXTComponent {
  connectedCallback() {
    // Initialize component styles and settings
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      <style>
        :host {
          display: block;
          background-color: #f4f4f4;
        }
      </style>
      <div class="container">
        <button>Click Me!</button>
      </div>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('my-component', MyComponent);

In this example, the WXT component uses the Shadow DOM for style encapsulation, and CSS is scoped to the component itself.
Conclusion

By following these strategies, you can ensure that your Chrome extension's CSS is optimized, clean, and DRY. Key steps include:

    Properly scoping styles for the Shadow DOM using :host and :global selectors.
    Removing duplicate CSS styles and consolidating similar rules.
    Using tools like PurgeCSS to eliminate unused styles.
    Using CSS variables and reusable components to maintain a DRY codebase.
